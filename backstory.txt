CONFIDENTIAL TRANSMISSION
FROM: Dr. Eleanor Quantum, Founder & CEO
TO: New Operative
Welcome to the Quantum Corporation's Multiverse Division.

Our discovery of the Quantum Nexus has allowed us to access
multiple parallel realities, each with their own unique characteristics.

Your mission is of the utmost importance:
1. Establish business operations across these universes
2. Gather Quantum Credits - the only currency that maintains value across all realities
3. Build a network that will allow us to stabilize the fracturing multiverse

Our scientists have detected dangerous instabilities in the multiverse fabric.
These interdimensional fluctuations threaten to collapse all realities into one.
Only by establishing a network of businesses across multiple universes
can we generate enough Quantum Credits to power our stabilization technology.

You'll begin in the Blade Runner universe - a dystopian future where
AI technology thrives but is highly regulated. As you progress,
you'll gain access to other universes, each with their own unique
challenges and opportunities.

Be cautious - if your activities draw too much attention in any universe,
local authorities will detect your interdimensional nature,
forcing a permanent retreat from that reality.

The fate of all realities rests in your hands. Good luck, Tycoon.
